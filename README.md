# Hands-On Machine Learning Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my personal projects, practice code, and notes based on the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron. It focuses on applying key machine learning concepts to real-world datasets.

## Features
- **Chapter-Specific Code**: Exercises and implementations aligned with the book’s chapters.  
- **Real-World Datasets**: Practice with housing data and other sample datasets.  
- **Key Concepts Covered**:  
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing/capped data)  
  - Visualization and exploratory data analysis  
  - Implementing machine learning models  
  - Fine-tuning and evaluating models  
  - Introduction to Neural Networks and TensorFlow basics  

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - TensorFlow (optional for deep learning sections)  

## Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BigAchiever/Practicing-ML.git
